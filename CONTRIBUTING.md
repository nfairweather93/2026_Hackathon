## Developers 🤓
- Nathan Fairweather (fairweather.3@wright.edu)
- Grant Rynders (rynders.3@wright.edu)

## Environment Details 🌳
The application was built in *VSCode*, with a live server plugin to test the website in real time.

## How Can You Contribute? ❓
As always, you can't! Admire the website in it's glory, but mourn in the fact that it will never be updated again.

## Code of Conduct ⚖️
Take as much as you would like. In no way do we care if our code is used, stolen, or referenced, as long as it does not get us in legal trouble! And, with that, all the scraped information is also public as is, so no worries about grabbing that, either.

# Future Considerations 📅

---

## Possible Additions 🚧
Because of the application's reliance on a few *Rate My Professor* statistics, there is room for expansion, adding additional data sets such as:
- The most common tags ("Lecture Heavy", "Caring", Etc.) found on their profile
- The top comments on a professor's profile
- The number of comments (whether many or few) on their profile
These data sets could hypothetically be used as weight in the calculation of salary efficiency, but also for only display purposes.

## Missed Opportunities 🚨
Realistically speaking, we were two not-very-creative computer science majors that needed to put a lot of effort into frontend development and CSS. If possible, it would have been nice to have another creativity-driven individual to focus on the style and looks of our website, but we made the best with what we had.

## Plans for Continuation 📜
As this project was crammed into a sleepless, caffeinated 24-hour time period, some part of our souls would like to never look at it again. I will never guarantee that it will not be built upon during a later point in time, but the odds look to dropping the project quite favorably.
